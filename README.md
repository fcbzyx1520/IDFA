## What's this app about?

IDFA is a small but handy utility application to help developers and
users to easily access their Advertising Identifier (IDFA) for testing
purposes.

The Apple Identifier for Advertisers was introduced in iOS 6.0.

## Configuration

The only optional configuration is adding a `settings.plist` to add your
`FLURRY_API_KEY` in it. If you do not want to use Flurry Analytics, you
can safely remove its code.
